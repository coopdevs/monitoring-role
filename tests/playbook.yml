        apply:  # not required. Accepts a hash of task keywords (e.g. C(tags), C(become)) that will be applied to all tasks within the included role.
        tasks_from: main # not required. File to load from a role's C(tasks/) directory.
        vars_from: main # not required. File to load from a role's C(vars/) directory.
        defaults_from: main # not required. File to load from a role's C(defaults/) directory.
        allow_duplicates: True # not required. Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
        public: False # not required. This option dictates whether the role's C(vars) and C(defaults) are exposed to the playbook. If set to C(yes) the variables will be available to tasks following the C(include_role) task. This functionality differs from standard variable exposure for roles listed under the C(roles) header or C(import_role) as they are exposed at playbook parsing time, and available to earlier roles and tasks as well.
        handlers_from: main # not required. File to load from a role's C(handlers/) directory.
